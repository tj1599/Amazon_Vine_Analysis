# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Analysis
H0: 5star_vine = 5star_not_vine (no difference in the percentage (proportion) of 5 star ratings paid (vine) vs unpaid (not vine)
Ha: 5star_vine <> 5star_not_vine (there is a difference)

* percentage_5star_vine = 38.24%
* percentage_5star_not_vine = 54.47%
* finding: The percentage of 5star ratings is not the same when comparing vine reviews to not_vine reviews
* There is reason to believe that the percentage of 5star ratings is not directly tied to whether the review is paid or unpaid
* note: this hypothesis test would need to be evaluated comparing the proportion of 5 star reviews among the two samples
